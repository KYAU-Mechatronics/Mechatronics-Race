 We started video recording from the beginig of the car racing day. We took several video from different place at different time.
 The first shot I took from outside of the university. I took another videoclip from inside of Mechatronics lab. The race was held on another class room(Room No. 212). 
 Then we used "DaVinci Resolve" for editing.
